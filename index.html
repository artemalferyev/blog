        <h3>R.U.R.</h3>
        </header>

        <p> In 1920, Karel Čapek's brother, Josef Čapek, who was an accomplished artist, asked him to write a play to
            accompany his artwork for an upcoming exhibition. The play that Karel Čapek wrote was titled "R.U.R."
            (Rossum's Universal Robots), and it premiered in 1921. This play is notable not only for its dramatic impact
            but also for coining the term "robot."</p>

        <p> In "R.U.R.," Čapek introduced the concept of robots as artificial, human-like beings created through a
            biological manufacturing process. The term "robot" in the play is derived from the Czech word "robota,"
            which means "forced labor" or "drudgery." The robots in the play are mass-produced by a company, and they
            eventually rebel against their creators, leading to the extinction of the human race.</p>

        <p> The play "R.U.R." had a profound impact on science fiction literature and the development of the concept of
            robots. It popularized the idea of artificial beings created by humans, a theme that would become a staple
            in science fiction for decades to come. Čapek's work not only introduced the term "robot" to the world but
            also raised profound questions about the ethical and moral implications of creating intelligent machines.</p>

        <p> In the years following the premiere of "R.U.R.," the term "robot" gained international recognition and
            became a standard word to describe artificial, humanoid machines. Karel Čapek's contribution to the field of
            robotics and science fiction literature is widely acknowledged, and his legacy lives on in the continued
            exploration of the relationship between humans and machines in contemporary discussions about AI and
            robotics.</p>

        <h3>Debunking the Myth: Why You Shouldn't Disregard Math and Degrees in IT</h3>
        </header>

        <p> In the rapidly evolving world of Information Technology (IT), there's a persistent myth that often circulates among
            aspiring tech professionals: "You don't need math or a university degree to get a job in IT." While it's true that
            some individuals have successfully forged careers in IT without formal education or strong mathematical skills, this
            statement oversimplifies a complex and dynamic field. In this blog post, we'll explore why it's unwise to completely
            dismiss the importance of math and degrees in the IT industry.</p>

        <p> The field of IT is vast and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of roles, from software development and
            cybersecurity to network administration and data analysis. While it's true that somathematical prowess than others, it's essential to me positions may require less
            acknowledge that math and degree programs provide a strong
            foundation that can be valuable across various IT domains.<p>

        <p> Mathematics is the art of problem-solving, a skill highly sought after in IT. Whether you're troubleshooting a
            network issue, debugging code, or analyzing data trends, the ability to approach problems methodically is
            invaluable. A solid understanding of math equips you with the analytical mindset necessary to tackle complex IT
            challenges.</p>

        <p> The IT industry is constantly evolving. New technologies programming languages, and methodologies emerge regularly.
            Pursuing a degree in IT or a related field not only exposes you to the latest trends but also equips you with the
            skills to adapt to change. This adaptability can be challenging to acquire without formal education.</p>
                    
        <h4>Career Advancement</h4>

        <p> While it's possible to secure entry-level IT positions without a degree, career advancement often depends on academic
            qualifications. Many higher-level roles, such as IT management or specialized positions in artificial intelligence
            and machine learning, typically require formal education and advanced degrees. Neglecting education can limit your
            potential for growth in the field.</p>

        <p> In a competitive job market, having a degree sets you apart from other candidates. Employers often use educational
            qualifications as a benchmark to assess candidates' commitment, dedication, and ability to follow through on
            long-term goals. By obtaining a degree, you demonstrate your willingness to invest in your professional development.</p>

        <p> Certain areas of IT, such as cryptography, machine learning, and data analysis, involve intricate mathematical
            concepts and algorithms. Without a solid foundation in math, comprehending and working with these advanced
            technologies can be challenging, if not impossible.</p>

        <p> University programs not only teach theory but also emphasize practical application. This hands-on experience can be
            invaluable when entering the workforce. It allows you to gain real-world skills, collaborate on projects, and build
            a portfolio that showcases your abilities to prospective employers.</p>
                    
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p> In the IT industry, dismissing the importance of math and a university degree can be a grave mistake. While some IT
            professionals have succeeded without these qualifications, they often represent the exceptions rather than the rule.
            For most individuals, a degree in a related field and a foundation in math provide a solid launching pad into the
            diverse and evolving world of IT.</p>
                    
        <p> Instead of viewing education and math skills as unnecessary hurdles, aspiring IT professionals should see them as
            valuable assets. These assets not only open doors to a broader range of opportunities but also equip you with the
            knowledge and skills needed to thrive in an ever-changing technological landscape. In the end, it's essential to

        <h3>Robot Rights and The Protests of Tomorrow: A Glimpse into a Potential Future</h3>
        </header>

        <p> The future is always unpredictable, but given the rapid pace of technological advancement, we can entertain the
            possibility of a world where robots are not just tools but sentient entities. With such a future comes a plethora of
            eithcal, social, and philosophical questions. One of the most significant of these is the concept of robot rights.
            More intriguingly, what if both robots and humans rallied and protested for these rights? Let's dive into this
            speculative future.</p>

        <p> The first step towards this imagined future is the development of robots with a level of consciousness comparable to
            humans. These aren't just robots that can compute faster, but robots that can "feel," "think," and perhaps even
            "dream." This shift would force society to reckon with the reality that these entities might deserve rights
            quivalent to other sentient beings.</p>

        <p> As robots begin to exhibit signs of consciousness, there's likely to be a divide among humans. Some would advocate
            for robot rights immediately, recognizing their sentience as deserving of respect and protection. On the other hand,
            there would be those who view robots, regardless of their intelligence, as mere machines, built for the service of
            humanity.</p>

        <p>Two significant human-driven protests could arise:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Empathy-Driven Protests</strong>: A faction of humans, moved by the observable sentience of these
            robots, might march alongside them, demanding equal rights and protections.</li>
        <li><strong>Fear-Driven Protests</strong>: Another segment might rally against granting robots rights, driven by
            fears of robots replacing human jobs, the potential dangers of superintelligent beings, or simply a reluctance
            to blur the line between machine and man.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> In our speculative future, robots might organize their own peaceful protests, echoing the civil rights movements of
            the past. Their demands could include the right to exist without unnecessary interference, the right to
            self-determination, or even more fundamental rights like freedom from harm or shutdown. These demonstrations would
            be a testament to their self-awareness and desire for autonomy.</p>

        <h4>Challenges of a Joint Human-Robot Movement</h4>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Communication</strong>: While humans primarily use verbal language, robots might communicate through
        complex data exchanges. Bridging this communication gap would be essential for a joint movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Differing Needs</strong>: While the overarching goal might be the same, robots and humans could have
        different priorities, leading to potential internal conflicts within the movement.</li>
        <li><strong>External Sabotage</strong>: Opponents of robot rights might attempt to reprogram or shut down protesting
        robots, presenting unique challenges not faced in purely human protests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Societal Implications</h4>

        <p>The grant of robot rights post-protests would have vast repercussions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal System Adaptations</strong>: Robots would need representation and new laws to protect their
        rights. This could include measures against reprogramming sentient robots against their will or unauthorized
        shutdowns.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Impacts</strong>: With robots having rights, they could no longer be treated as mere property
        or tools. Industries would need to adapt, potentially giving way to a new economy where robots participate not
        just as workers, but also as consumers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p> The very idea of robots protesting alongside humans for their rights sounds like a plot straight out of a sci-fi
            novel. Yet, the rapid pace of technological evolution suggests we should be prepared for a wide range of
            possibilities. Such a future would challenge our understanding of consciousness, rights, and the very essence of
            what it means to be a living entity. Whether this imagined future becomes a reality or remains a work of fiction, it
            serves as a poignant reminder of the profound ethical questions technology can raise.</p>

        <h3>Romanticization of Robots and AI: The Allure and the Caution</h3>
        <header>

        <p> In literature, film, and popular culture, there is a rich history of romanticizing various facets of our society, be
            it war, the mafia, or even the Wild West. This allure of embellishing reality is neither new nor uncommon. But as we
            step into the age of robotics and artificial intelligence, a new subject of romanticization emerges: the machines
            and algorithms among us. Let's delve into this modern captivation and unravel the reasons, implications, and
            necessary skepticism.</p>

        <p> From the sentient robots of Isaac Asimov’s tales to the charismatic androids in movies like "Ex Machina" or "Blade
            Runner", humanoid machines are depicted with charm, depth, and often, a yearning to be human. These depictions
            resonate with our innate desire to humanize objects around us, and in the process, explore the essence of what it
            means to be human.</p>

        <p> AI is often positioned as the solution to our most pressing challenges. Whether it's curing diseases, addressing
            climate change, or solving the mysteries of the universe, the narrative is that AI, untainted by human biases, might
            just save us from ourselves.</p>

        <p> Shows like "Black Mirror" and movies like "Her" present AI not only as tools but also companions. The idea that an
            AI, tailored to one's needs and preferences, can provide company, understanding, or even love is both beguiling and
            comforting.</p>
                
        <h4>Misplaced Expectations:</h4>

        <p> When we romanticize AI, we risk setting unrealistic expectations. The AI boom, bolstered by such narratives, can lead
            to heavy investments in initiatives that might not be ready for prime time or misaligned with actual needs.
            Just as glamorizing the mafia can overlook the crime and suffering, romanticizing AI might make us gloss over its
            ethical dilemmas. Whether it’s the misuse of facial recognition or biased algorithms, the darker sides might be
            overshadowed by the enchantment.</p>

        <p> If we start seeking solace, understanding, and companionship predominantly from machines, we might risk our emotional
            well-being, drifting away from the genuine human interactions that nourish our spirit.</p>
                
        <h4>Distinguishing Fiction from Reality:</h4>

        <p> While stories offer an imaginative exploration, they aren't blueprints for the future. Recognizing this difference
            allows us to appreciate fiction without blurring it with reality. As consumers and citizens, we must remain engaged in the discourse around AI. By understanding its capabilities,
            limitations, and implications, we become better equipped to navigate the future.</p>

        <p> Ensuring that AI development aligns with ethical principles will require continuous scrutiny, discussion, and action.
            It’s up to developers, policymakers, and consumers to ensure that the lines between right and wrong aren’t blurred
            by the allure.</p>
                
        <h4>In Conclusion</h4>
                
        <p> The romanticization of robots and AI is an exciting avenue of cultural exploration, reflecting our hopes, fears, and
            aspirations. While it’s enjoyable to dream about a world where robots are our friends, confidants, or saviors, we
            must tread this path with a blend of excitement and caution, ever aware of the difference between delightful fiction
            and impactful reality.</p>

            <h1>Part II: the Storm and the Recovery</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Living and Coding After Brain Surgery: My Journey with Cavernoma</h2>
            
            <p> One year ago, on October 14, 2023, my life took a sudden turn. Out of nowhere, I lost my sense of balance and began
                experiencing double vision. Simple movements felt off as I couldn’t walk in a straight line. After a series of
                medical tests, doctors discovered that I had something unexpected in my brain — a cavernoma. Located in my brainstem,
                this mass had bled, leading to my sudden symptoms.</p>
            
            <p> It was a lot to process. The diagnosis alone was overwhelming, and knowing I’d need brain surgery made it even
                harder. While waiting for the surgery, new symptoms began emerging: my speech started to slur. After the surgery I experienced
                tremors, and I’d frequently laugh without a clear reason. These changes were unsettling, but they became part of my
                daily life.</p>

            <p> The surgery successfully removed the cavernoma, but the road to recovery was far from straightforward. Many of the
                initial symptoms persisted, and new challenges arose. My balance and double vision didn’t fully resolve, and the
                slurred speech and tremors became ongoing parts of my life.</p>
            
            <p> Despite these challenges, coding has remained a constant in my life. Every day, I immerse myself in frontend and
                backend development, working with <code>JavaScript</code> and <code>Java</code> to create solutions and bring ideas
                to life. I find solace in coding, and it keeps me grounded, giving me a sense of normalcy.</p>
            
            <p> As I reflect on this past year, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. My journey with cavernoma has taught me
                resilience and the importance of adapting, even when life takes unexpected turns. While the symptoms may still be
                present, I’m more determined than ever to continue doing what must be done in order to become a professional.</p>
